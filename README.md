### Hi! I'm Francesco!

- I'm a software engineer working with Red Hat

- I really like distributed systems, system programming, operating systems internals in general

- I'm currently:

  
  - Contributing to improve kubernetes/OpenShift, to make sure they are a great platform for telco workloads
  
  - Contributing to [GHW](https://github.com/jaypipes/ghw)!  
  
  - Writing a lot of golang
  

- Someday:
  - I'll finish my lisp book(s) :/
